So my quiz starts out by saying Brett's Quiz Press Start button to begin. Upon click of the start button the text goes away and a question with 4 possible answer button appears. At the same time in the top right corner a timer starts to count down every second starting from 75 seconds. Upon click of a answer button you are shown a new question with a new set of answer buttons. Also if your answer is incorrect 5 seconds is taken away from your total time remaining and if it reaches zero the quiz ends. Upon completion of all the questions you are shown your total score for the quiz and are asked to input your initials and press the submit button. Upon click of the submit button you are brought to a new highscore screen where you are shown all previous scores stored in your localstorage at the time.
